## YAML Community

The YAML community hangs out on IRC (irc.libera.chat).
There are a few different channels:

* `#yaml` - Get help or discuss YAML ideas
* `#yaml-dev` - People working on YAML frameworks or YAML itself
* `#libyaml` - Discuss the YAML C library project
* `#pyyaml` - Python's YAML channel

> If you want to use IRC but don't know how, just click -> [libera web chat](https://web.libera.chat/).
> All you have to do is enter a unique nickname and one of the channel names above, then click **Start**.
>
> **Note**: The `#` is important; ie use `#yaml`, not `yaml` for the channel name.
