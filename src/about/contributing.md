title: Contributing to yaml.com
---
This yaml.com website is built using the [ProjectSite](https://project-site.org) static site builder framework.
The site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
All of the content and configuration information is in this [Git repository](https://github.com/yaml/www.yaml.com).

There are 3 ways to easily contribute to the website.
Note that all of them require you to be a logged-in GitHub user.
If you don't have an account, signing up is painless.

1. If you see a typo or grammar mistake, just click the edit button (little pencil icon) on the top of each page.
   This will take you to that page's source location on GitHub.
   Assuming you are a logged-in GitHub user, you should see another pencil icon to actually edit the page on GitHub.
   Click that link, make your changes and then click the "Propose changes" button at the bottom that page.
   Click the "Create pull request" and you are done!
2. If you want to make a more major change like adding a new page or fixing a bug, following these relatively easy [instructions](https://project-site.org/doc/forking-a-projectsite/).
3. If you just want to tell us what's wrong, you can file a [new issue](https://github.com/yaml/www.yaml.com/issues).

We look forward to your ideas!
